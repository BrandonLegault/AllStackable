`/allstackable show hand [player]` : show information about an item on a player's hand.

`/allstackable reset all` : revert all changes.

`/allstackable reset [item]` : reset a specified item.

`/allstackable reset hand [player]` : reset an item on a player's hand.

`/allstackable set [itemID] [count]` : set the max stackable count of a specified item.

*Notes:*

[1]. Settings are stored in the SAVE folder of the current world, which means you can move your world anywhere you want without reconfiguring this mod.

[2]. To migrate the config from one world to another world, just copy and paste the config to the current world folder and use /allstackable reload

[3]. Localization is now available! Feel free to contribute.

 

***SERVER USE: You should install this mod on both sides. The server will automatically let clients know what item should be modified and sync.***

 

*KIND WARN:*

[1]. If you use multiple damageable items simultaneously, the durability of them all drop. Don't do that.

[2]. Have a test before using stacked consumable items. A minority of them may disappear all at once.
